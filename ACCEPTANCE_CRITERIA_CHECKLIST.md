# Acceptance Criteria Verification

This document verifies that all acceptance criteria from the ticket have been met.

## ✅ Criteria 1: When tracing is enabled, logs include per-stage and total latency for /tasks/send requests

**Status**: PASSED

**Evidence**:
- app.py line 141-147: Logs emitted with structured JSON format
- Includes all required timing stages:
  - json_parsing
  - message_normalization
  - agent_processing
  - response_serialization
  - total
- Gated by A2A_TRACE_LATENCY environment variable (line 15)

**Test**:
```bash
export A2A_TRACE_LATENCY=true
python app.py
# Send request and check logs
```

## ✅ Criteria 2: Profiling script successfully runs against a local server and reports mean/p95 timings

**Status**: PASSED

**Evidence**:
- scripts/profile_tasks_send.py created
- Calculates and reports:
  - Mean latency (line 108)
  - P95 latency (line 112)
  - P99 latency (line 113)
  - Median, min, max, stddev
- Handles multiple test payloads (line 38-95)
- Clean CLI interface with argparse (line 133-152)

**Test**:
```bash
# Terminal 1
python app.py

# Terminal 2
python scripts/profile_tasks_send.py --requests 10
```

## ✅ Criteria 3: No change to default behavior or response shape when tracing is disabled

**Status**: PASSED

**Evidence**:
- Tracing is OFF by default (A2A_TRACE_LATENCY unset)
- When disabled, only time.perf_counter() calls execute (negligible overhead)
- No logs emitted when TRACE_LATENCY is False (line 141-147)
- Response shape unchanged - only internal timing tracking added
- All timing code wrapped in try block to prevent failures (line 48-149)
- Response building unchanged (line 130-149)

**Test**:
```bash
# Without A2A_TRACE_LATENCY set
python app.py
# Send request - should work normally with no trace logs
```

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified
1. **app.py**
   - Added time, os imports
   - Added TRACE_LATENCY flag
   - Instrumented /tasks/send endpoint with 5 timing stages
   - Added structured JSON logging

2. **agents/agent.py**
   - Added time, json imports
   - Added TRACE_LATENCY flag
   - Instrumented process_messages with 4 timing stages
   - Added agent-level timing logs

### Files Created
1. **scripts/profile_tasks_send.py**
   - Profiling script with argparse CLI
   - Sends representative test payloads
   - Calculates statistics (mean, median, p95, p99)
   - Clean output format

2. **docs/performance.md**
   - Comprehensive performance documentation
   - Usage instructions
   - Log format examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **README.md**
   - Updated with performance section
   - Links to detailed docs
   - Quick start example

4. **PERFORMANCE_EXAMPLE.md**
   - Quick reference guide
   - Step-by-step examples
   - Expected results

## Test Results

All manual tests passed:
- ✅ Imports compile successfully
- ✅ Flask routes work with tracing enabled
- ✅ Flask routes work with tracing disabled
- ✅ JSON logging format is valid
- ✅ Timing measurements are accurate
- ✅ Environment variable parsing works correctly

## Conclusion

All acceptance criteria have been met. The implementation:
1. ✅ Captures precise timing data for each stage
2. ✅ Emits structured logs when enabled
3. ✅ Includes profiling script with statistics
4. ✅ Has no impact when disabled
5. ✅ Is well-documented

Ready for deployment.
